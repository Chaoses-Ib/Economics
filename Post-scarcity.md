**Post-scarcity** is a theoretical economic situation in which most goods can be produced in great abundance with minimal human labor needed, so that they become available to all very cheaply or even freely. Post-scarcity does not mean that scarcity has been eliminated for all goods and services but that all people can easily have their basic survival needs met along with some significant proportion of their desires for goods and services.

Richard Stallman 于 1985 年在 [The GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html) 中写道：

> In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the postscarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living from programming.
> 
> We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition. Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production. We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.

随着信息化的到来，信息在许多地区已经进入了后稀缺时代，智能的后稀缺正在被 AI 所实现，而这之后就将由体能和实体产品迎来后稀缺了，到最后，实体原料将成为制约生产力的唯一要素，届时，航天可能会又一次迎来热潮。
