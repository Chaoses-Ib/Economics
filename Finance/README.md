[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance)

**Finance** is the study and discipline of money, currency and capital assets. It is related to, but not synonymous with economics, which is the study of production, distribution, and consumption of money, assets, goods and services (the discipline of financial economics bridges the two).
